# Student Performance Classification Using Knowledge-Based Rules and Naive Bayes

This project explores student performance prediction using a combination of knowledge-based rules and the Naive Bayes classifier. The dataset contains student grades, absences, study time, and other relevant features. The notebook demonstrates:

- Data exploration: Distribution of final grades (G3), absences, and study time.
- Data visualization: Histograms and correlation heatmaps to understand relationships between features.
- Knowledge-based rules: Categorizing students into Poor, Average, Good, and Excellent based on grades and absences.
- Machine learning classification: Naive Bayes model to predict student performance categories.
- Evaluation: Accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix for performance assessment.

This repository is ideal for beginners in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, showing how to combine rules-based systems with probabilistic classifiers for prediction tasks.
